# Linux and macOS dotfiles

This repository contains the various dotfiles that I use on my Linux and macOS development workstations. In both instances, Z Shell is used along with powerlevel10k and pyenv. The following sections details additional information and requirements.

## Linux

TBD

## macOS

The dotfiles depend on Homebrew being installed. Due to the Homebrew path differences on Intel-based systems and Apple Silicon-based systems, I have created directories, `macos-intel` and `macos-arm64`, for each architecture that reflect the different paths.
